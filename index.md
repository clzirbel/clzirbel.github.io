## Professional projects

My colleague Neocles Leontis and I led the BGSU RNA Group for many years.
Our websites and services are found at http://rna.bgsu.edu and have been live since 2011.
Our code is posted publicly at the GitHub sites below.

- [BGSU RNA Group GitHub site](https://github.com/BGSU-RNA) hosts many repositories that support the weekly update pipeline
- [fr3d-python](https://github.com/BGSU-RNA/fr3d-python) is a Python package which reads RNA and DNA 3D structure files in mmCIF and PDB formats, annotates basepairs and other pairwise interactions, and extracts hairpin and internal loops and multi-helix junctions.  The same package supports the [Web-FR3D search tool](https://rna.bgsu.edu/fr3d/) and the [R3DCID circular diagram maker](https://rna.bgsu.edu/fr3d/r3dcid).
