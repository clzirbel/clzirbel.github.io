# Resources Created by Craig L. Zirbel

I'm an applied mathematician, data analyst, bioinformatician, mathematics teacher, and software developer.

## Software Projects

- The [Photo and Video Annotator](https://clzirbel.github.io/pva_photo_video_annotator/) is a desktop application for annotating photos and videos with text descriptions.
Annotate, rotate, duplicate, and crop images.
Annotate videos at different timestamps, skip segments, and adjust volume of the video
- The [investment return calculator](https://clzirbel.github.io/investment_return_calculator/) calculates a single average rate of return on a series of investments over time.
- [Magistra](https://github.com/clzirbel/magistra) helps you learn words and phrases in whatever language you like.
Provided vocabulary lists in French, German, and Spanish proceed from the most basic and important words to groups orgranized thematically.

## RNA 3D Structure Annotation and Analysis

My colleague Neocles Leontis and I led the BGSU RNA Group for many years.
Our websites and services are found at http://rna.bgsu.edu and have been live since 2011.
Our code is posted publicly at the GitHub sites below.
- [BGSU RNA Group GitHub site](https://github.com/BGSU-RNA) hosts many repositories that support the weekly update pipeline
- [fr3d-python](https://github.com/BGSU-RNA/fr3d-python) is a Python package which reads RNA and DNA 3D structure files in mmCIF and PDB formats, annotates basepairs and other pairwise interactions, and extracts hairpin and internal loops and multi-helix junctions.  The same package supports the [Web-FR3D search tool](https://rna.bgsu.edu/fr3d/) and the [R3DCID circular diagram maker](https://rna.bgsu.edu/fr3d/r3dcid).

## Teaching Resources

 - A [comprehensive guide for first-time college mathematics teachers](https://sites.google.com/view/teaching-college-mathematics/home), including graduate students who are new to the US
 - The [group activity proof course](https://github.com/clzirbel/GroupActivityProofCourse)
is a set of exercises I developed a course for mathematics majors to learn to write proofs by working in groups in class on carefully-designed activities, while the teacher circulates from group to group to answer questions and check work.
It's all activity, all the time and it works very well.
- [Lecture notes](https://sites.google.com/view/clzirbel/lecture-notes) from calculus, linear algebra, probability/statistics, stochastic processes, and advanced probability courses
- [Activities that replace lectures](https://sites.google.com/view/clzirbel/activities-that-replace-lectures) is a collection of carefully-written exercises that students can do in groups in class, which works better than you just talking at them.
- [Dynamic programming activities](https://sites.google.com/view/clzirbel/dynamic-programming) can be used with students from junior high to PhD level to learn the basic idea of dynamic programming
- [Start programming](https://sites.google.com/view/start-programming/) is a set of exercises for math people who are learning to program, with selected solutions in various languages
- [Chess activities](https://sites.google.com/view/clzirbel/chess) designed for beginners who are just learning the game
- [Blackjack talk](https://clzirbel.github.io/blackjack_talk_2001.pdf) teaches optimal stopping of Markov chains, with Blackjack being the running example
- [Monopoly graphs](https://clzirbel.github.io/monopoly.pdf) shows where you and your opponents are mostly likely to land, and how much income you can expect to get from investing different amounts of money in the different monopolies
